    <h1>WHO IS SAMIEJAA?</h1>
    <p>A little something about me :3</p>

    <section class="aboutme-info">
        <p>
          Samiejaa is a 17 year old boy (He/They) who dreams big for his future.
        </p>
        <p>
            He has been dreaming of making music since he was a little kid and has been experimenting with a lot of different genres and programs since 2023.
            In 2024 he found love for the electronic/dance/scene or krushclub genre. In 2025 he set himself a goal. To produce and release a bunch of music and experiment with his style.
            He is currently making multiple different genres and still trying to find his unique style. This includes variations of Indie/pop/rock, and EDM genres.
        </p>
        <p>
            Samiejaa also enjoys programming of multiple diffrent sorts. Both hardware and software are interesting for him. This website is in fact coded by himself and he has also been working on a big VR psyochological horror game, in the hopes of revolutionizing VR games and bring back quality gameplay. Because of school and other freetime projects this game is kind of a on/off thing.
        </p>
        <p>
            For school he is taking a communications/it and design education and spends most of his time there. He learns about how when you create a product (both physically and digitally) you most affectively can make it userfriendly and easy to use. He learns about the whole design process and what effect and thoughts it can give the user as well as he learns different types of IT. Including programming, animating, 3d modelling and physical media.
